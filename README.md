## Quick setup

`git clone https://github.com/gmackie/personalWebsite`

`cd personalWebsite`

`jekyll server`

Check out your awesome blog at `http://localhost:4000` and Cheers!

## Dockerizing
The `Dockerfile` in the repo will copy the compiled output of `jekyll build`
(located in `./_site/`) and stash it inside an nginx docker container and host
the site on port 80. This can then be pushed to Docker Hub and then used in
conjunction with the helm chart [here](https://github.com/gmackie/charts/) to
deploy the blog to Kubernetes!
