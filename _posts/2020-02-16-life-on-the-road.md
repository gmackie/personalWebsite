### Life on the Road
For the past 10 days, I have been living out of a suitcase, a duffel bag, and a
snowboard bag while making my way from my home in Michigan out to Seattle (and
soon on to Whistler). 

One of the biggest learnings that I have had on this trip is the need for me to
write down more of what I am learning and experiencing and being able to
preserve that knowledge for others to then also learn. To that point, I am going
to try to set aside some time each day, both for work and for my everyday life,
to not just journal, but to take an idea and turn it into an amount of writing
that more or less consititutes a 'blog post'. In doing so, I hope to not only
just record what I am learning, but to also improve my writing over time so that
these posts will be able to not only be read, but enjoyed by people.

Writing is one of the most important skills a professional can have. Written
documents are long lasting artifacts that are used to communicate thoughts,
ideas, desires, fears, motivations, etc.
