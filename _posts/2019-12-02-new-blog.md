# New Blog, New Me
It's been a while since I have put a personal blog together, but I think this
might be the motivation that I need to finally do it. I have set everything up
to make it as easy as possible to add new content to this. All of my blog posts
will be in markdown and saved to a repo on github. Who knows? Maybe the commit
streak in and of itself will be enough to keep me motivated to keep posting.
Some topics I am looking forward to posting:

1. Supercon Badge
  * Adding I2C HW
  * Communicating w/ I2C HW
1. Kubernetes/kubeadm setup
1. Keezer build
1. Keezer Electronics (Arduino/CircuitPy)
1. Woodshop build
1. Music Making


### Conclusion
Before I write too much, I should draw this to a close to save some energy for
the next time I write on here, which should be soon. Hopefully.
