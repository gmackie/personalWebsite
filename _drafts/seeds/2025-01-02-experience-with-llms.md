## Hook Ideas
- "I talk to AI more than I talk to most humans. Here's what I've learned."
- "LLMs didn't replace me. They changed how I think about work."
- "The tool that made me both 10x more productive and deeply uncertain about the future"

## Outline

### Section 1: The Evolution of My Usage
- When I started using LLMs seriously
- The progression: toy → curiosity → tool → daily essential
- Current state: which models, which interfaces, how often

### Section 2: What I Actually Use Them For
- **Coding**: Copilot, chat-based assistance, debugging
  - What works: boilerplate, unfamiliar APIs, explaining code
  - What doesn't: complex architecture, subtle bugs
- **Writing**: drafting, editing, brainstorming
- **Learning**: explaining concepts, exploring topics
- **Work tasks**: emails, documentation, analysis
- **Personal**: random questions, creative projects

### Section 3: The Productivity Reality
- Honest assessment: am I actually more productive?
- Tasks that are genuinely faster
- Tasks where I waste time wrestling with AI
- The meta-cost: time spent prompting, checking, iterating
- Net effect on output quality

### Section 4: How It Changed My Thinking
- I write differently knowing I can expand/refine
- I start projects differently (sketch with AI help)
- Research patterns changed
- The "good enough to start" threshold lowered
- Unexpected: it made me value human expertise more

### Section 5: The Failures and Frustrations
- Hallucinations and confident wrongness
- When it "almost" works (the worst case)
- Tasks I've given up on using AI for
- The uncanny valley of AI output
- Over-reliance and skill atrophy concerns

### Section 6: Practical Lessons
- Prompting patterns that actually work for me
- When to reach for AI vs when not to
- Verification strategies
- Tool choices and why (specific models/apps)
- Cost considerations

### Section 7: The Bigger Picture
- What this means for my career/skills
- The jobs question (thoughtfully, not reactively)
- What I'm learning in anticipation of future AI
- Things I'm deliberately NOT outsourcing to AI

## Conclusion Direction
- LLMs are a tool, and I'm still learning to use it well
- The honest assessment: better at some things, complicated at others
- What I'm watching for next

## Notes
- Topic type: reflection + practical
- Be specific and honest — avoid hype or doom
- Include concrete examples of prompts/outputs if illustrative
- This is a "state of the union" personal piece, not a tutorial
- Date it clearly — this will age quickly
