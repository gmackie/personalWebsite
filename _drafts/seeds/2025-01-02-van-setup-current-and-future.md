## Hook Ideas
- "My van is a 400 square foot apartment, a mobile office, and a future robotics project"
- "Most van builds stop at 'it works.' I want mine to be programmable."
- "From manual switches to industrial control systems — overengineering a camper van"

## Outline

### Section 1: The Van Platform
- Vehicle specs (make, model, year, why this one)
- Overall build philosophy
- Timeline and current state (hence "v0.5")

### Section 2: Current v0.5 Setup — What's Built
- **Layout and living space**
  - Bed, kitchen, storage approach
  - What works, what I'd change
- **Electrical system**
  - Solar, batteries, inverter specs
  - Current monitoring (if any)
  - Manual switching and controls
- **Water system**
  - Fresh/grey tank setup
  - Pump, filtration
- **Climate**
  - Heating solution
  - Ventilation/cooling
  - Insulation approach

### Section 3: What "v0.5" Means — The Gaps
- Things that work but aren't smart
- Manual processes that are annoying
- Missing instrumentation and visibility
- Why the current state is "good enough for now"

### Section 4: The Vision — IIoT Van Control System
- What "industrial IoT" means in this context
- Why I'm thinking like an industrial controls engineer, not a home automation hobbyist
- The control system I want to build:
  - Centralized monitoring (tank levels, battery state, temperatures)
  - Automated controls (pump management, load shedding)
  - Remote access and alerting
  - Data logging and trends

### Section 5: Technical Architecture (Planned)
- Microcontroller platform (ESP32? something else?)
- Sensor suite (what to measure, how)
- Communication (MQTT, local network, cloud?)
- Interface (touchscreen? phone app? both?)
- Integration with existing systems
- Reliability and failure modes — this runs my house

### Section 6: Why Bother?
- Practical benefits (peace of mind, efficiency)
- The real reason: it's a fascinating project
- Skills this builds (embedded, controls, integration)

## Conclusion Direction
- Current status on the IIoT project
- What's blocking progress
- Open invitation for ideas/collaboration

## Notes
- Topic type: journey + technical project
- Two posts in one: current state tour + future vision
- Could split into separate posts if it gets too long
- Photos essential for the current setup section
- Keep the IIoT section from being vaporware — ground it in concrete plans
