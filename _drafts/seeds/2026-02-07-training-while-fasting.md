excerpt: "Everyone says you can't build muscle while doing regular 72-hour fasts. Here's the training program I use that says otherwise - and why the conventional wisdom misses the point."

## Hook Ideas

1. **The gym bro reaction** - Open with the conversation that happens every time someone at the gym finds out I regularly don't eat for three days. The look of horror. "Bro, you're losing all your gains." Except I'm not. The numbers keep going up. Here's why the conventional "eat big to get big" crowd is working with an incomplete model.

2. **The 72-hour PR** - Start with a specific moment: hitting a deadlift PR on day two of a fast. It shouldn't work according to everything the fitness industry tells you. But the body is more resilient than the supplement companies want you to believe, and the trick is knowing which days to push and which days to back off.

3. **The spreadsheet collision** - I have two schedules that shouldn't overlap: a rolling 72-hour fasting protocol and a 4-day training split. Making them work together was a puzzle. The solution is counterintuitive - you don't train less when fasting, you train differently. And the results have been better than when I was eating 4,000 calories a day.

## Outline

### 1. The Fasting Schedule: Context You Need First
- Quick overview of the rolling 72-hour fast protocol
- The feeding windows: OMAD keto refeeds between fasts
- Why this matters for training: you're not "always fasted" - it's a cycle
- The metabolic state differences between hour 20 and hour 60
- Setting expectations: this isn't about training in a 16:8 window, this is different

### 2. The Split: Upper/Lower, 4 Days, Built Around Food
- The basic structure: Upper A, Lower A, Upper B, Lower B
- The key insight: heavy compound days align with fed days
- Light days and cardio align with fasted days
- Why this specific split works better than push/pull/legs for this protocol
- Rest day placement and why it's not arbitrary

### 3. Fed Day Training: Where the Growth Happens
- Heavy compounds: squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press
- Why compound movements get priority over isolation work
- The double progression method: reps first, then weight
- Rep ranges and why I stick to the 5-8 range on these days
- The post-training meal: why this is the most important meal of the cycle
- How to know when to push vs. when the fast has taken too much

### 4. Fasted Day Training: Active Recovery That's Still Productive
- Light cardio: zone 2 work, walking, easy cycling
- Why I don't just skip the gym on fasted days
- The HIIT question: when to do it and when it's stupid
- Mobility work and the stuff nobody wants to do
- Listening to your body vs. being soft - where's the line on a 60-hour fast

### 5. Progressive Overload When Your Calories Are a Rollercoaster
- The standard advice assumes consistent caloric surplus - that's not us
- Double progression explained: hit the top of your rep range, then add weight
- Why weekly progression still works even with multi-day fasts
- Tracking what matters: trend lines over individual sessions
- Deload timing and how fasting weeks sometimes ARE the deload
- The psychological game: not panicking when a fasted session feels weak

### 6. Real Results and Honest Lessons
- What actually happened to my lifts over 6+ months
- Body composition changes: the recomp effect of fasting + training
- Things I got wrong initially and had to adjust
- The recovery variable: sleep and supplements matter more in this protocol
- Who this works for and who should probably not try it

## Conclusion Direction
The fitness industry sells simplicity: eat surplus, lift heavy, repeat. That works. But it's not the only thing that works. Fasting + strength training is a different optimization - you're trading maximum hypertrophy for a package deal of strength, body composition, metabolic health, and longevity. The key is being smart about which days you push and which days you coast. Your body is more adaptable than the bodybuilding forums give it credit for.

## Notes
- Cross-link to [Biohacking Supplement Stack](/articles/2026-02/biohacking-supplement-stack) for the supplement support that makes this sustainable
- Cross-link to [Keto OMAD Nutrition](/articles/2026-02/keto-omad-nutrition) for what refeed meals actually look like
- Include actual numbers where possible - people want to see the lifts, not just theory
- Avoid the "fasting cures everything" tone - be balanced about trade-offs
- Mention that this took months to dial in; don't present it as plug-and-play
- Tone: pragmatic lifter, not fasting evangelist. "This works for me and here's the data" energy
