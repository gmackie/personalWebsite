## Hook Ideas
- "The developer tools startup sells to the fintech startup sells to the HR startup sells to the developer tools startup."
- "What happens when an entire ecosystem's revenue comes from inside the ecosystem?"
- "We're all just moving VC money in a circle"

## Outline

### Section 1: The Observation
- Startups buying from startups buying from startups
- The B2B SaaS loop
- Real examples from experience (anonymized if needed)
  - Dev tools, infrastructure, HR/ops tools all selling to each other
- This isn't inherently bad, but it's worth examining

### Section 2: How We Got Here
- VC money floods in, needs to be spent
- "Move fast" means buying solutions, not building them
- Startups are ideal customers: fast decisions, growth-focused, similar culture
- Enterprise sales is hard; selling to other startups is easier
- The "startups for startups" category explodes

### Section 3: The Economic Reality
- Where does the actual money come from? (VC → salaries → SaaS spend)
- Is value being created or just redistributed?
- The difference between:
  - Startups that eventually sell to real enterprises/consumers
  - Startups that only ever sell to other startups
- When does this become a house of cards?

### Section 4: The Sustainability Question
- What happens when VC money tightens (like 2022-2023)?
- Cascading churn when startups cut costs
- Which companies survive vs which were propped up by the ecosystem?
- The "profitable at any funding level" test

### Section 5: The Counterargument — Maybe It's Fine
- Specialization and division of labor is good
- Some of these tools genuinely create value
- The ecosystem does produce real companies eventually
- Not every business needs to sell to "normal people"

### Section 6: What This Means for Builders
- If you're building a startup: who are your customers, really?
- If you're working at one: understanding the business model
- Diversification beyond the startup bubble
- Signs you might be too dependent on the ecosystem

## Conclusion Direction
- Not a doom-and-gloom prediction
- A prompt to think critically about business models
- The question: "If all VCs stopped funding tomorrow, would my customers still exist?"

## Notes
- Topic type: opinion / observation
- This could be controversial — be thoughtful, not edgy
- Use specific examples but be careful about naming names negatively
- Acknowledge complexity; avoid "startups bad" reductionism
- The ouroboros (snake eating its tail) metaphor is strong — use it
