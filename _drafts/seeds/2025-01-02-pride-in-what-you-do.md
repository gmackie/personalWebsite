## Hook Ideas
- "The code worked. But I stayed late to make it *good*."
- "My grandfather built furniture that outlasted him. What am I building?"
- "Pride isn't arrogance. It's giving a damn."

## Outline

### Section 1: What Pride in Work Actually Means
- Not ego or showing off
- The internal standard that says "this isn't done yet"
- Caring about quality when no one would notice if you didn't
- The difference between "working" and "done well"

### Section 2: Where I Learned This (Or Didn't)
- Personal story/example of encountering this ethic
- Someone who modeled it (mentor, family member, colleague?)
- A time I didn't have it and felt the absence
- How this value developed over time

### Section 3: The Craft Mindset
- Treating work as craft, not just tasks
- The satisfaction of something done right
- How this applies beyond traditionally "creative" work
- Examples: code, writing, building things, even emails

### Section 4: The Tension — When Pride Becomes a Problem
- Perfectionism vs craftsmanship (they're different)
- Knowing when "good enough" is actually good enough
- The business reality: sometimes shipping matters more
- Finding balance without losing the standard

### Section 5: Why It Matters
- To you: satisfaction, growth, identity
- To others: trust, reliability, inspiration
- To the work itself: quality compounds over time
- The long game of building a reputation

### Section 6: Cultivating It
- Practical ways to develop this mindset
- Environment and culture effects
- What to do when you don't feel it
- Protecting it from burnout

## Conclusion Direction
- This is a choice you make repeatedly, not a trait you have
- The quiet satisfaction of work you're proud of
- Encouragement without being preachy

## Notes
- Topic type: personal reflection / philosophy
- Keep it grounded in concrete examples, not abstract moralizing
- Be honest about the tensions and tradeoffs
- This could come across as preachy — write it as self-reflection, not advice
- Shorter is probably better here; don't overexplain
