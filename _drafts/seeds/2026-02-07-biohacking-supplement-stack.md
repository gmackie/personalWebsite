## Hook Ideas

1. **The bathroom counter** - Open with the visual of my bathroom counter looking like a pharmacy exploded. The moment a friend sees it and asks "are you dying?" No, the opposite, actually. But it raises the real question: is any of this doing anything, or am I just an expensive placebo machine?

2. **The monthly supplement bill** - Start with the dollar amount. It's embarrassing. Then work backward from "why would anyone spend this" to the systems-thinking approach that got me here. The punchline: the supplements are actually the least important part of the stack.

3. **The cycling spreadsheet** - Open with the fact that I have a spreadsheet that tells me which supplements to take on which days because half of them need to be cycled on and off. At some point you have to ask yourself whether you've crossed the line from "optimizing health" to "having a weird hobby."

## Outline

### 1. The Hierarchy: Why Supplements Are the Smallest Lever
- The real stack is sleep, fasting, training, nutrition - in that order
- Supplements are the marginal gains on top of the fundamentals
- If your sleep is garbage, no amount of ashwagandha is saving you
- Why I think of it as systems, not individual pills
- The 80/20 reality: most of the benefit comes from like 5 things

### 2. Organizing by System, Not by Bottle
- Why I group everything by biological goal rather than just "morning pills"
- The major systems: hormonal support, fasting support, liver/detox, cardiovascular, cognitive
- How this framing changed what I take and when I take it
- The difference between "I read this is good for you" and "this serves a specific purpose in my protocol"

### 3. The Big Stacks: What I Actually Take
- HGH and testosterone support: the foundational hormone stack
- Fasting support: what makes 72-hour fasts manageable (electrolytes, adaptogens, etc.)
- Liver and detox: the unsexy but important stuff when you're cycling compounds
- Cardiovascular: the boring-but-will-keep-me-alive stack
- Cognitive: the ones I notice most day-to-day
- Reproductive health: yes, this is its own category when you're doing extended fasts

### 4. Cycling Protocols: Why You Can't Just Take Everything Every Day
- Receptor downregulation in plain English
- Which supplements need cycling and why
- My actual cycling schedule (without making this a spreadsheet dump)
- The ones you should never cycle off (basics like magnesium, D3, omega-3)
- How fasting days change the stack

### 5. The Honest Assessment: What I Think Actually Works
- The supplements I'd keep if I could only pick five
- The ones I take "just in case" with low confidence
- Things I've dropped after testing
- The bloodwork story: what actually moved the needle vs. what didn't
- Why I keep the full stack despite uncertainty (the asymmetry argument)

### 6. Common Pushback and My Responses
- "You're just making expensive urine" - partially true, here's the nuance
- "Just eat real food" - I do, and here's why I still supplement
- "Have you tried just... not doing all this?" - yes, here's what happened
- The role of n=1 experimentation vs. waiting for perfect RCTs

## Conclusion Direction
Land on the meta-point: the supplement stack isn't really the point. The point is paying attention to your body as a system, being willing to experiment, and being honest about what's working. Most of the gains come from the boring stuff (sleep, don't eat garbage, lift heavy things). The supplements are the fun part, not the important part. But if you've already nailed the basics, here's where the marginal gains live.

## Notes
- Cross-link to [Training While Fasting](/articles/2026-02/training-while-fasting) for the training integration
- Cross-link to [Keto OMAD Nutrition](/articles/2026-02/keto-omad-nutrition) for the nutrition foundation
- Keep specific dosages and brand names - people always ask
- Include a disclaimer about "not a doctor, this is n=1, talk to your physician" without being preachy about it
- Consider a table or visual for the cycling schedule - walls of text won't land
- Tone check: confident but not guru-ish. "Here's what I do" not "here's what you should do"
