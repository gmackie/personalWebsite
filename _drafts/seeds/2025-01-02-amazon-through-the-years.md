I joined Amazon as one thing and left as another. So did Amazon.

That's the short version. The long version involves a decade of writing documents nobody wanted to read, arguing about the right way to page an oncall engineer at 3 AM, and slowly realizing that the things I found most annoying about the place were the same things that made me better at my job.

## Why I walked in the door

I interned at Amazon the summer before my senior year at Michigan. I was twenty-one, writing Java, and mostly trying not to break anything. The internship was fine -- good enough that when they offered me a full-time role after graduation, I said yes without overthinking it. I'd had a good experience, Seattle sounded like an adventure, and I didn't have a better plan.

That's not the origin story people want to hear. Nobody wants "I didn't have a better plan." But it's honest. I wasn't chasing Amazon specifically. I was chasing a job where the problems were hard and the people were smart. Amazon happened to be the place that said yes first.

I started full-time in August 2014 as an SDE. Seattle was gray and unfamiliar. The office smelled like free bananas. I had no idea what I was doing.

## The operating system

Everyone talks about Amazon's Leadership Principles. From the outside, they sound like corporate motivational posters. Fourteen slogans on a wall. Customer Obsession. Ownership. Bias for Action. Frugality. The usual stuff.

From the inside, they're something different. They're the operating system.

I don't mean that metaphorically. I mean that every meeting, every design review, every hiring decision, every promotion discussion runs on the same vocabulary. When someone pushes back on your proposal, they don't say "I don't like it." They say "I'm not sure this is thinking big enough" or "Where's the customer working backwards from?" When you're writing a performance review, you're mapping your accomplishments to specific principles. When you're interviewing a candidate, each interviewer is assigned specific principles to evaluate.

It's weird at first. Then it's clarifying. Then it becomes how you think.

The principles I internalized most deeply were Ownership and Bias for Action. Ownership at Amazon means something specific: you don't get to say "that's not my team's problem." If you see it, you own it. If the system you built pages someone at 2 AM, that's your 2 AM. Not in a punitive way -- in a "your name is on this" way. It changes how you build things. You write better alerts because you're the one who gets woken up. You write better documentation because you're the one who has to read it six months later.

Bias for Action is the one that stuck with me most. Many decisions are reversible. Don't study them to death. Make a call, move, learn, correct. I was naturally someone who wanted more data before deciding. Amazon trained that out of me, and I'm grateful for it.

## Writing as thinking

The thing that surprised me most about Amazon was the writing culture.

No PowerPoint in meetings. Instead, you write a document -- a six-pager or a one-pager or a PR/FAQ -- and everyone reads it silently at the start of the meeting. Then you discuss.

I hated this at first. I wanted to just talk through my ideas. Writing them down felt slow and painful. But that was exactly the point. Writing forces clarity. You can't hide behind a charismatic delivery or a flashy slide. The logic either holds up on paper or it doesn't.

I spent more time writing documents at Amazon than writing code, especially after I moved into management. And the document culture made me a dramatically better thinker. Not because writing is magic, but because writing forces you to confront the parts of your argument that are hand-wavy. "We should do X because it'll be better" doesn't survive a six-pager. You have to say better for whom, measured how, at what cost, compared to what alternative.

I still write before I think through any serious decision. That's an Amazon habit I'll never lose.

## Bar raisers and the hiring loop

Amazon's hiring process is intense, and the bar raiser system is the best part of it. A bar raiser is someone outside the hiring team who joins the interview loop with one job: protect the hiring bar. They can veto a hire. They don't report to the hiring manager. They have no incentive to fill the role fast.

I became a bar raiser, and it taught me more about evaluating people than anything else in my career. When you've done hundreds of interviews with the explicit job of saying "not good enough," you develop a calibration that's hard to get any other way. You learn to separate "this person is likeable" from "this person will raise the bar." You learn to spot the difference between someone who did the work and someone who was in the room when the work happened.

It also taught me that hiring is the highest-leverage thing a manager does. Get it right and everything else gets easier. Get it wrong and no amount of process will save you.

## Becoming a manager

I moved from SDE to SDM in March 2017, about two and a half years into my full-time tenure. I didn't plan a management career. I just kept gravitating toward the parts of the job that involved people and systems instead of just code.

Amazon is a place where engineering managers are expected to be technical. You're not a project manager with an engineering title. You're expected to review designs, understand the code, debug operational issues, and make architectural calls. That suited me. I didn't want to stop being technical -- I wanted to add people and strategy on top.

The transition was harder than I expected. Writing code, I could see my output every day. Managing people, the feedback loops are months long. Did that coaching conversation help? You won't know for a quarter. Did hiring that person raise the team's bar? Give it six months. The delayed gratification is brutal for someone used to compiling and running.

But it taught me patience, and it taught me that the most important work often doesn't feel productive in the moment.

## The hard parts

I'm going to be honest about this, because I think the honest version is more useful than the polished one.

Amazon is intense. Not in a "we work hard and play hard" motivational poster way. In a "the expectations are genuinely very high and the pace doesn't let up" way. The leadership principles that make the culture clear and effective also make it relentless. There's always another bar to raise. There's always a way your system could be more available, your document could be sharper, your team could be delivering faster.

For years, I found that energizing. The pace suited me. I liked that mediocrity wasn't comfortable. I liked that people cared enough to argue about the right answer.

But intensity compounds. The operational load -- oncall, tickets, launches, operational reviews -- accumulates. The writing culture that sharpens your thinking also means every proposal is a gauntlet. Some weeks the relentlessness felt less like high standards and more like a treadmill that speeds up no matter how fast you run.

I also missed things I didn't realize I valued. Slack in the schedule. Time to explore without justifying the business case. The freedom to do something just because it was interesting. Amazon optimizes for output, and that optimization is real. It costs something.

I'm not complaining. I'm describing a tradeoff. Some people thrive in that environment for twenty years. Some burn out in two. Most of us land somewhere in between, and the honest answer is that both the thriving and the burning are responses to the same thing.

## How I changed

The person who walked out of Amazon was different from the person who walked in, in ways I'm still discovering.

I became a better writer. Not in a literary sense -- in a "can organize complex ideas clearly under pressure" sense. That's the document culture.

I became faster at making decisions. Not reckless. Faster. Bias for Action rewired my defaults from "wait for more information" to "what's the minimum I need to move?"

I developed strong opinions about operational excellence. If you haven't been paged at 3 AM for a bug you shipped, you don't really feel the feedback loop. I did. Repeatedly. It makes you allergic to cutting corners.

I got much better at hiring and at coaching people. Bar raising gave me calibration. Managing gave me reps. Amazon's focus on mechanisms over intentions taught me that good management is about building systems that work even when the manager isn't paying attention.

And I became comfortable with being wrong. Amazon's culture of disagree and commit means you'll frequently do things you argued against. Sometimes you were right and the decision was wrong. Sometimes you were wrong and the decision was right. Either way, you learn to separate your ego from the outcome.

## What I took with me

Some Amazon habits became permanent parts of how I operate:

**Write first, then talk.** If I can't write it down clearly, I don't understand it well enough to discuss it.

**Own the problem.** Not my team, not my department -- if I see it and I can help, it's mine.

**Mechanisms over intentions.** Good intentions don't fix recurring problems. Systems do.

**Hire slow.** The cost of a bad hire is always worse than the cost of an open role.

**Move before you're ready.** Most decisions are reversible. Waiting for certainty is its own kind of failure.

Some things I deliberately left behind. The relentlessness. The assumption that every minute should be optimized. The subtle pressure to frame everything in terms of business impact. Some things are worth doing because they're interesting or human or fun, and they don't need a business case.

## Looking back

I spent over a decade at Amazon, from a nervous intern to a manager leading teams building things used by millions of people. It's the kind of experience that shapes you in ways you can't fully see while you're in it.

I'm grateful for it. Not in a corporate-alumni-network way. In a genuine, this-place-made-me-better way. The intensity that sometimes exhausted me is the same intensity that forced me to grow. The writing culture that felt like a burden taught me to think clearly. The leadership principles that sounded like slogans became a mental framework I still use every day.

Amazon is not for everyone. It wasn't always easy for me. But for a specific kind of person at a specific point in their career -- someone who wants to be pushed, who wants clarity over comfort, who wants to build things at a scale that demands discipline -- it's a remarkable place to spend some years.

I joined Amazon as a kid who could write code. I left as someone who could build teams, think in systems, and ship things that mattered. The place changed a lot in those years. So did I.
