excerpt: "When you eat one meal a day in a keto protocol sandwiched between 72-hour fasts, people have questions. Here's what that actually looks like - the meals, the logic, and the weird social dynamics."

## Hook Ideas

1. **The dinner party explanation** - Open with trying to explain your eating schedule at a dinner party. "So you just... don't eat? For three days? And then you eat one meal? And it's all fat and meat?" The look on people's faces. The immediate concern that you have an eating disorder. The awkward moment when you're visibly healthier than everyone at the table who's worried about you.

2. **The single plate** - Start with a description of THE meal. One plate. It has to contain everything your body needs to build muscle, support hormone production, fuel your brain, and carry you until the next feeding window. No pressure. Here's what's on it and why every item earned its spot.

3. **The anti-meal-prep** - Everyone in the fitness world is doing meal prep with six tupperware containers. I have one meal. One. The irony is that my "meal prep" is actually more obsessive than theirs because when you only eat once, that meal has to be dialed. Here's what that looks like.

## Outline

### 1. The Protocol: How the Eating Schedule Actually Works
- The big picture: 72-hour fasts punctuated by OMAD keto refeeding days
- What a typical week looks like on the calendar
- Why keto specifically (not just calorie restriction or regular OMAD)
- The metabolic logic: staying fat-adapted so the fasts aren't brutal
- How long it took to adapt vs. where I am now

### 2. Breaking a 72-Hour Fast: Don't Be an Idiot About It
- Why you can't just crush a ribeye after 3 days of not eating
- The refeeding approach: what the first meal back looks like
- Bone broth, easy fats, and giving your gut time to wake up
- The mistake I made early on and what happened (be honest about this)
- Timing: how long between breaking the fast and the "real" meal

### 3. The Meal: What's Actually on the Plate
- The steak and eggs baseline: why this is the default
- The salmon plate variation: when and why I rotate
- Building the plate: protein first, fats second, fibrous veg as the vehicle
- Specific examples with rough portions - not gram-counting, but not winging it
- The role of organ meats and why I force myself to include them
- What I drink: water, black coffee, electrolytes, and not much else

### 4. Eating for Hormones, Not Just Macros
- Why food selection goes beyond "is it keto"
- Foods that support testosterone: what the research actually says vs. bro science
- Cholesterol and saturated fat: why I'm not afraid of them and the hormone connection
- The foods I prioritize: red meat, eggs, wild-caught fish, cruciferous veg
- Micronutrient density matters more when you only eat once
- Why "clean keto" vs. "dirty keto" is a real distinction in this protocol

### 5. The Banned List: What I Don't Eat and Why
- Seed oils: the short version of why they're out
- Soy: the hormone disruption concern and where it hides
- Sugar and high-glycemic carbs: obvious, but the "why" matters for keto adaptation
- Processed food in general: when you eat once, you can't waste it on garbage
- Alcohol: the uncomfortable truth about how it interacts with this protocol
- The 80/20 reality: how strict am I actually? (honest answer)

### 6. Sustainability, Social Eating, and the Long Game
- How to handle restaurants without being insufferable
- The social pressure problem: people really don't like when you don't eat
- Travel and how the protocol adapts (or doesn't)
- Is this sustainable long-term or is it a phase?
- The mental relationship with food: has this made it better or worse?
- Who should try this and who absolutely should not

## Conclusion Direction
This isn't a diet in the way most people think about diets. It's more like a simplified operating system for food. By constraining when and what I eat, I've paradoxically spent less total mental energy on food than when I was eating three meals a day and snacking. The single meal becomes a ritual rather than a chore. The fasts become normal rather than extreme. And the food itself becomes better because when you only eat once, you make it count. That said - this is weird, it's not for everyone, and the social friction is real.

## Notes
- Cross-link to [Biohacking Supplement Stack](/articles/2026-02/biohacking-supplement-stack) for the supplements that support this protocol
- Cross-link to [Training While Fasting](/articles/2026-02/training-while-fasting) for how training integrates with the eating schedule
- Include a few actual meal photos if possible - people eat with their eyes
- Don't preach about keto or carnivore ideology - just "here's what I do and why"
- Be real about the downsides: social isolation at meals, the initial adaptation hell, the occasional day where one meal isn't enough
- Tone: the friend who eats weird but is self-aware about it. Not the guy who won't shut up about seed oils at brunch.
