## Hook Ideas
- "The Zoom call dropped. Again. I was parked in a national forest with 'full bars.'"
- "Starlink changed everything about working from a van — but it's not magic"
- "How I get better internet in the mountains than most hotels"

## Outline

### Section 1: The Mobile Internet Problem
- Remote work from a van requires *reliable* internet, not just *some* internet
- Why phone hotspots aren't enough (throttling, coverage gaps, latency)
- The before: constant anxiety about connectivity

### Section 2: The Hardware Stack
- Starlink Roam (or whichever dish model)
  - Mounting solution for the van
  - Power requirements and considerations
- LTE Router setup
  - Router model and why
  - Antenna setup (MIMO, placement)
  - SIM/carrier strategy (which plans, why)
- How they work together (failover setup)

### Section 3: Network Architecture
- Router/gateway handling both connections
- Automatic failover configuration
- Bonding vs failover — what I chose and why
- VPN considerations for work
- Network diagram if helpful

### Section 4: Real-World Performance
- Starlink: what works, what doesn't
  - Tree cover, weather, movement
  - Latency for video calls
- LTE: when it saves the day
  - Coverage where Starlink struggles
  - Data usage patterns
- Actual speeds and reliability numbers from experience

### Section 5: Power Management
- Starlink power draw (it's not small)
- Running on solar/battery
- When to turn things off
- Total power budget for the internet system

### Section 6: Costs and Tradeoffs
- Monthly costs breakdown
- Hardware investment
- Is it worth it? For whom?

## Conclusion Direction
- The freedom this setup enables
- What I'd do differently
- Future improvements planned

## Notes
- Topic type: technical project
- Include photos of the setup if available
- Real numbers matter here — people searching for this want specifics
- Consider a "what I'd recommend for different budgets" section
