Woo, 2 years later and finally back to write a new blog post. Maybe now with AI, I can force myself to be a bit more consistent, now that I can give myself basically everything that I need in order to write the article. 


I think that there is a big part of the coding atmosphere that requires people to actually think hard about what it is that they are building and maybe if the AI could do that too then it would actually be able to develop something good. like maybe just tell it to slow down and think before it takes off and starts building stuff. 

Its interesting that 5 months later its still the same feeling that yotu can be the tastemaker and AI is the little bitch slop bot that cranks out the needful. I suppose they are trying to figure out if they can keep getting more and more high level to the point where if you just describe the killer features, the AI has learned enough about human behaviour to really innovate and get people to use things more than they are supposed to in order to maximize profits. The AI will learn how to capitialize and abuse the human brain which will lead to this arms race
