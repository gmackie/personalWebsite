## Already Tracked

These notes have significant overlap with topics in `blog-topics-tracker.md`:

- **VaultAgent.md** → matches "AI as Life Companion" in Ready to Write section and "AI Interaction Series" in Series Potential
- **ClassCheck.md** → similar to "ClassBack Admin System" in Ready to Write (both K-12 EdTech)
- **GachaHabit.md** → relates to "Building Better Habits" draft in Ready to Write
- **Health.md / Training.md / Nutrition.md** → could feed into "Building Better Habits" (draft exists) or new health-focused posts
- **Kooltit.md** → related concept to "Turntable.bot" in Creative/Experimental (both streaming/media tools)

## Scoring Methodology

| Criterion | Max Points | How Scored |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Word Count | 40 | 500 words = 20pts, 1000+ = 40pts, linear between |
| Structure | 30 | Headers, sections, tables, diagrams, code blocks |
| Frontmatter | 15 | Tags, status, dates present |
| Recency | 15 | Modified within last 30 days |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Wins (Ready to Draft)
1. **VaultAgent** - Most complete, unique angle (voice + AI + personal knowledge management)
2. **Health Stack** - Strong content, personal experience, actionable takeaways
3. **Training Program** - Detailed, practical, pairs well with health content

### Series Opportunity
The three Health notes (Health.md, Training.md, Nutrition.md) could become a 3-part series:
1. "The Stack: Supplements for Hormones, Performance, and Longevity"
2. "Strength Training on Extended Fasts"
3. "Keto OMAD: Breaking a 72-Hour Fast"

### Needs Development
- **Learning.md** - Add BJJ first-class story, skiing adventures, personal learning philosophy
- **Finance/Relationships/Work** - Too skeletal for blog content currently
