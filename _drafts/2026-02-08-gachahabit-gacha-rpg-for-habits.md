Every habit tracker I've ever used has the same arc. Week one is incredible. Week two the streak starts to feel important. Week three missing a day feels like failure instead of a data point. Week four I stop opening the app.

It's not that these apps are badly designed. Most of them are fine. The problem is that checkmarks are not a durable reward.

GachaHabit is my attempt to build a habit tracker where the reward actually pulls you back.

## Steal the engagement loop from gacha games

Gacha games are not subtle about why they work. Collection, progression, scarcity, anticipation, layered goals. You can criticize the ethics -- and sometimes you should -- but you can't deny that these loops are absurdly good at making people open the app tomorrow.

Habit apps, by contrast, offer streak counters, badges, and inspirational quotes. Those create a "I should open this" feeling, and "should" is not a foundation you can build retention on.

So the question I can't let go of: what happens if you build a real game, and the only way to play it is to do the habit?

## You can't pay to skip

This is the line I refuse to cross.

In most gacha games, money substitutes for time or effort. In a habit product, that breaks the entire point. If you can swipe a credit card to keep your streak alive, you're not building consistency -- you're selling cosmetics for guilt.

So the core design constraint is simple: the only currency faucet is completing real habits. That's it. No shortcuts, no premium pulls, no "watch an ad for 50 gems." You do the habit, you earn the currency, you pull characters, you progress. The habit is the input for the game.

The psychological shift I'm aiming for is the difference between "I drank water, so I have a streak" and "I drank water, so I'm five pulls closer to pity on the banner I care about." One of those is a checkmark. The other is anticipation.

## What the game actually feels like

I don't want a habit app with a cartoon pet that says "good job" when you check a box. The game part needs enough depth that you'd actually play it.

Here's what I'm building toward: a turn-based battle system with elemental types. You pull characters from banners, each with a type affinity (fire, water, nature, etc.) and a role (tank, healer, DPS). Team composition matters -- you're not just throwing your strongest character at every fight. A water-heavy team gets wrecked by a nature boss. A team with no healer can't survive multi-round encounters. You actually have to think about what you're building toward.

Progression looks like: complete your morning habits, earn currency, spend it on banner pulls. Get a new character, slot them into your team, take on the next stage. Pity is built in so pulls feel fair -- you're always making progress toward a guaranteed pull, never just dumping currency into a void. There are dailies, weeklies, and limited-time events that give structure to coming back.

The goal isn't to make the habit app "fun" in an abstract sense. It's to make the reward legible and specific. There's a real difference between "you earned 10 points" and "you earned a pull, and the next pull might complete a team that can clear the stage you've been stuck on." One of those feels like progress. The other feels like UI.

## Monetization without breaking the constraint

The business model isn't locked in, but the shape is probably familiar: a free tier with limitations, a premium subscription for unlimited habits and better cosmetics, seasonal battle passes, and purely cosmetic purchases.

The rule is that nothing you buy can substitute for doing the habit. Premium gets you cooler-looking characters, not stronger ones. A battle pass gives you extra cosmetic rewards on top of the pulls you earned, not replacement pulls. If monetization ever undermines the constraint, the product becomes a different thing, and I'm not interested in that different thing.

## What success looks like

This one has a simple metric: does it retain?

If GachaHabit can hit meaningful day-30 retention, it earns more investment. If it can't, it was an interesting experiment and I move on. The nice thing about habit products is the scoreboard is brutally clear -- either people are opening the app on day 30 or they're not.

This is one of [five MVPs I'm building in parallel](/articles/2026-02/building-five-mvps-with-ai) using a shared stack and a structured AI workflow. The meta post explains why that's less reckless than it sounds.
