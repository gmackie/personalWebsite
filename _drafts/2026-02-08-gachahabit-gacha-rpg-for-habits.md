I've tried a lot of habit tracking apps.

The pattern is always the same. Week 1 feels incredible. You're a new person. You have a system. You have momentum. Week 2 is when the streak starts to matter. Week 3 is when missing one day feels like a failure instead of a data point. Week 4 is when you stop opening the app.

It's not that these apps are badly designed. Most of them are fine. Some of them are beautiful. The problem is that checkmarks are not a durable reward.

GachaHabit is my attempt to build a habit tracker that doesn't depend on willpower.

## The thesis: steal engagement mechanics from gacha games

Gacha games aren't subtle about why they work. Collection, progression, scarcity, anticipation ("one more pull"), layered goals (dailies, weeklies, events). You can criticize the ethics (and you should, sometimes), but you can't deny that these loops are extremely good at getting people to come back tomorrow.

Habit apps, by contrast, tend to offer streak counters, badges, and inspirational quotes. Those are fine, but they don't create a strong "I want to open this right now" loop. They create a "I should open this" loop, and "should" is not a reliable foundation.

So the question that won't leave me alone is: what happens if you build a real game, and the only way to play is to do the habit?

## The constraint that makes it interesting: you can't pay to skip

This is the line I'm not willing to cross.

In most gacha games, money can substitute for time or effort. In a habit product, that breaks the point. If you can swipe a credit card to keep your streak alive, the product is no longer teaching consistency. It's just selling cosmetics for guilt.

So the design constraint for GachaHabit is simple: you cannot pay to skip.

The currency faucet is:

Complete habits -> earn currency -> pull characters -> progress the RPG.

That turns the habit into the input for entertainment.

And the shift I'm aiming for is psychological as much as mechanical. Instead of "I drank water, so I have a streak," it becomes "I drank water, so I'm five pulls closer to pity on the banner I care about."

## What "real game" means (and what it doesn't)

I don't want to build a habit app with a cartoon pet that says "good job" when you check a box.

I want the game part to have enough depth that you would actually play it. That means things like:

A pity-based banner system, because pulls need to feel fair enough that people don't feel tricked. Quests and missions that give structure to daily usage. A battle system that has enough depth to be satisfying. Progression that doesn't collapse after a week.

The goal isn't to make the habit app "fun" in an abstract sense. It's to make the reward legible and compelling.

There's a real difference between "you earned 10 points" and "you earned a pull, and the next pull might complete your set bonus." One of those feels like progress. The other feels like UI.

## Why now (for me)

Two timing reasons.

First, the habit app market is large and crowded, but the dominant mechanics are stale. Most apps still live in the streak/badge era.

Second, modern gacha design has evolved a lot compared to the early lootbox era. Pity systems, battle passes, events, and more generous reward structures are now standard in successful games.

Also: building this as a weekend project keeps the risk low. This is an experiment with a very clear scoreboard.

## Monetization (still flexible)

The business model is deliberately not locked in yet, but the shape is probably familiar: a free tier with limitations, a premium subscription (unlimited habits, better rewards, no ads), seasonal battle passes, and cosmetic purchases.

The rule is that monetization can't undermine the constraint. If the product becomes "pay to skip," it becomes a different thing. I'm not interested in that different thing.

## What success looks like

This one has a simple metric: does it retain?

If GachaHabit can hit meaningful retention (especially day 30), it earns more investment. If it can't, it's an interesting experiment and I move on.

Either way, I like the idea of treating habit formation like a game system that deserves as much design attention as any mobile RPG.
