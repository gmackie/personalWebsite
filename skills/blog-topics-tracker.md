## Writing Strategy

### Blog as Knowledge Repository
- **Document as you go**: Write posts while projects are fresh
- **Focus on lessons learned**: What would you want to remember in 6 months?
- **Include failures and pivots**: These are often the most valuable insights
- **Link to related projects**: Cross-reference your work for easy navigation

### Content for Social Media Amplification
- **Twitter threads**: Pull 3-5 key insights from each post
- **YouTube videos**: Use posts as detailed scripts/references
- **LinkedIn**: Professional development angle on learning posts
- **GitHub**: Link to relevant repos and technical details

### Realistic Publishing Goals
- **1 post per month**: Sustainable pace that builds momentum
- **Mix post types**: Rotate between technical, personal, and learning topics
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have fewer, well-documented posts

### Content Calendar Ideas

**January**: New Year, habits, goal-setting
- Building Better Habits (draft completion)
- Peloton Data Tracking setup

**February**: Winter projects, indoor builds
- RC2014 Computer Kit
- 3D Printing winter projects

**March**: Planning season, tool setups
- Stream Deck optimization
- Development environment improvements

**April**: Spring building season
- Van build progress updates
- Outdoor project preparation

**May**: Festival prep, outdoor tech
- Meshtastic for festival season
- Portable tech setups

**June**: Summer projects, mobile tech

## Notes Section

### Van Build Documentation Strategy
Document the entire van build process as a series. Each major system gets its own post:
- Electrical system and power management
- Network infrastructure 
- Storage and NAS setup
- Home automation integration
- Lessons learned and mistakes made

### Technical Depth Guidelines
- **Beginner-friendly**: Include background context
- **Code examples**: Always provide GitHub links
- **Troubleshooting**: Document problems and solutions
- **Follow-ups**: Link to related projects/posts

### Personal Story Integration
Every technical post should include:
- Why this project mattered personally
- What motivated the specific approach
- How it fits into larger life goals
- What you'd do differently next time
