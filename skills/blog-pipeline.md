# Blog Pipeline Strategy

## The 5-Draft System

**Concept**: Create 5 draft posts this month, then publish one per month with minimal stress about topic selection.

### January 2025: Draft Creation Month

**Target**: 5 complete drafts by end of January
**Approach**: Write when motivated, capture ideas while fresh
**Length**: 600-800 words each (enough detail to be useful, not overwhelming)

#### Recommended First 5 Drafts:

1. **Power Grid Multiplayer Server** (Technical) - _Most complete project, interesting architecture challenges_
2. **AI as Life Companion** (Personal/AI) - _Timely topic, personal experience_
3. **Smoker Temperature Monitoring** (Maker/IoT) - _Complete project with GitHub repo_
4. **Building Better Habits** (Personal Growth) - _Already started, finish the draft_
5. **NixOS Journey** (DevOps/Tools) - _Current exploration, good to document_

### Publishing Schedule (Feb-June 2025):

- **February**: Power Grid Server (technical depth)
- **March**: AI Life Companion (broader appeal)
- **April**: Smoker Monitoring (maker project)
- **May**: Better Habits (personal growth)
- **June**: NixOS Journey (tools/productivity)

### Writing Process:

#### Week 1-2: Brain Dump Phase
- Pick a project/topic you're excited about
- Open a new draft file: `_drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`
- Write everything you remember/think about the topic
- Don't worry about structure or polish
- Include specific examples, code snippets, failures, insights

#### Week 3-4: Structure and Polish
- Organize brain dump into coherent sections
- Add proper introduction and conclusion
- Include relevant links and images
- Get it to "good enough to publish" state
- Don't perfect it - aim for 80% done

#### Monthly Publishing:
- Pick the most polished draft from your queue
- Final review and minor edits
- Move from `_drafts/` to `_posts/`
- Publish and promote on social media

## Practice Writing Topics

Low-stakes topics to build writing muscle:

### Tech Tool Reviews (300 words)
- [ ] **Kinesis Advantage 360 Keyboard** - First impressions
- [ ] **Stream Deck Setup** - Productivity workflow
- [ ] **Atem Mini** - Video production thoughts

### Quick Project Updates (400 words)
- [ ] **Van Build Progress** - Current state and next steps
- [ ] **3D Printing Adventures** - Recent prints and learnings
- [ ] **Workshop Organization** - Setup and tool choices

### Learning Logs (500 words)
- [ ] **Weekly Learning Highlights** - New things discovered
- [ ] **Book/Course Reviews** - Quick takes on educational content
- [ ] **Conference/Event Summaries** - Key takeaways

### Opinion Pieces (600 words)
- [ ] **Development Tool Preferences** - Why I choose X over Y
- [ ] **Remote Work Observations** - What's working, what isn't
- [ ] **Industry Trend Thoughts** - Hot takes on tech developments

## Year-End Goal: Idea-to-Publish in <1 Week

**Target Timeline for December 2025:**
- Day 1: Idea and outline
- Day 2-3: First draft
- Day 4-5: Structure and polish
- Day 6: Final review
- Day 7: Publish

**Skills to Build:**
- Faster outlining (use templates)
- More efficient first drafts (voice-to-text?)
- Better editing process (focus on clarity over perfection)
- Consistent publishing routine

## Quality Standards

### Good Enough to Publish:
- Clear introduction that sets context
- 3-5 main points with specific examples
- Personal insights or lessons learned
- Proper front matter and categories
- Links to relevant resources/repos
- Conclusion that wraps up thoughts

### Don't Optimize For:
- Perfect prose (conversational is better)
- Comprehensive coverage (focus on your experience)
- SEO or audience growth (write for future you)
- Viral potential (authenticity over engagement)

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics (More Important):
- [ ] 5 drafts created by end of January
- [ ] Published 1 post per month Feb-June
- [ ] Reduced idea-to-publish time each quarter
- [ ] Consistent writing habit established

### Outcome Metrics (Nice to Have):
- [ ] Personal reference value (do I re-read my own posts?)
- [ ] Social media engagement on shared posts
- [ ] GitHub repo traffic from blog links
- [ ] Comments/questions from readers

## Monthly Review Questions

1. Which drafts are ready for publishing?
2. What new topics emerged from recent projects?
3. Which posts would make good YouTube content?
4. What writing habits are working/not working?
5. How can I improve the next batch of drafts?
